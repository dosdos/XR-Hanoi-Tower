## Abstract ##

This second course in the XR for Everybody specialization looks at how to design new user experiences for XR
technologies. The course provides learners with a design thinking mindset and equips them with a fundamental toolbox for
creating XR applications using rapid prototyping. It starts with a broad overview of the complete XR design process,
discussing different paths to becoming an XR creator, what is generally involved in making XR experiences, and how to
best get started. The course then emphasizes design thinking, critiques, and ethics while introducing guidelines and
user-centered techniques like design jams. The second half of the course introduces a variety of methods and tools for
prototyping both physically and digitally including on the XR devices themselves through immersive authoring.

The course has an honors track that guides learners through creating their own storyboard, physical prototype, and
digital prototype of an XR experience. You will work on exercises that allow you to practice your design skills and also
build XR technologies into your workflow by working with specific templates and new digital tools that allow you to
preview physical prototypes on AR/VR devices.
