# Extended Reality Specialization #

The purpose of this course is to get familiar with VR, AR, MR, and XR, understanding key issues about XR theory, design
and development. As final assignment, I implemented an augmented reality version of the Hanoi Tower game using with
WebXR.

The specialization is divided into 3 courses:

1. [Part 1 - Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR](Part%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20XR/README.md)
2. [Part 2 - UX & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR](Part%202%20-%20UX%20&%20Interaction%20Design%20for%20XR/README.md)
3. [Part 3 - Developing AR/VR/MR/XR with WebXR/Unity/Unreal](Part%203%20-%20Developing%20XR%20with%20WebXR/README.md)

The core of this specialization is unit 3, where a demo app is developed using WebXR.

I personally recommend this course since it provides a 360-degree overview of the XR world, not just focusing on
development, but facing complex topics like privacy and accessibility.

### Run the Hanoi Tower app with WebXR ###

Go to the [Part 3 README](Part%203%20-%20Developing%20XR%20with%20WebXR/README.md) to get the step-by-step instruction
about how to run the AR application I made for the final assignment.
