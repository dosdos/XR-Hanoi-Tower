# Part 1: Intro to XR #

PART 1 (**Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR)** from Extended Reality Specialization course by Michael Nebeling from University of Michigan.

### Issues ###

* Social and ethical concerns
* Accessibility and equity
* Privacy and security

### QOC for XR ###

QOC = Questions, Options, Criteria

Sample questions + options:
* how to
  * display?
  * track?
    * 3DOF
    * 6DOF
    * Inside-out
    * Outside-In
    * Marker-based
    * Marker-less
    * Face-based
    * Body-based
    * ...
  * travel?
  * manipulate?
  * collaborate?
  * ...

Sample criteria:
* User instrumentation
* Environment instrumentation
* Environment constraints
* Device constraints
* Device adoption
* Device cost 
* ...

### XR Strategy Panel ###

All the discussed topics were remarkably interesting, and the following two impressed me above all and made me think about the near future:
* XR tools are a terrifically effective means to practice and increase skills from remote (think about the applications in medicine)
* Human beings are used to always think in a 2D space, and they need to convert their knowledge from a 3D world to a 2D space: XR technologies could represent a game changer in the next years

### XR Student Panel Discussion ###

What were your main take-aways from this XR student panel?
What kinds of activities are worth organizing and supporting for students to learn about XR?
What are good strategies to help XR student initiatives succeed?

The initiative must always be rewarded, especially if it starts with students who want to get involved! 
The crucial point is that opportunities and connections between skills are created. 
One way to speed up the process is for universities to contribute by investing in the XR technology and make it available to students, since it's currently very expensive and not affordable for most of them.

## Assignment ##

### Question 1 ###

Describe which classes of issues (e.g., design issues, technical issues, user adoption, social acceptance) you focused on and why you consider them an important set of issues.
> I focused on the privacy and security concerns as I consider them a set of issues that are still very unclear and often not related to the technology used. 
> I tested the IKEA Place app for iPhone and Android that allows the user to virtually place IKEA products in your space. 
> The most concerning feature is the "visual search" function that allows the user to point the camera at any piece of furniture or object, and the app will tell which IKEA product it is or resembles the most. 
> In this process the user doesn't even realize that they are providing massive private and sensitive information. 
> I wasn't able to find the official app in the Android Play store. 
> Then, I suppose the app has been removed, since the link in the IKEA official page is broken. 
> Also installing the APK directly, I wasn't able to make it work with Android, then I need to use an iPhone.

### Question 2 ### 

Describe which one of the following activities you performed and why you chose to do that activity:
1. social VR meeting activity: joining a social VR platform for a virtual meeting;
2. object recognition activity: taking a photo of a physical object and manually performing object recognition via think aloud;
3. AR photo activity: taking an AR photo (or selfie) and assessing privacy impact considering the environment, people, anything else visible.
> I chose the object recognition activity, since I'd like to focus on the privacy and security concerns.

### Question 3 ### 

Provide your analysis of the impact on users:
- Who: Who is impacted by the issue(s)? Consider other users than yourself.
  > Who: every person whose privacy is impacted (also implicitly) by the visualization/scanning of the place by the IKEA app (for example a room mate, or a person depicted in a photo in the wall).
- What/Why: What is the problem from your perspective? Can you give an example to make it clear why it is a problem?
  > What/Why: the concern is about the implicit privacy that is violated scanning the place where the user is, with an accuracy "down to the millimetre", and with the understanding of fabrics and colours all around the space.
- When/Where: Under which circumstances is the impact on users the largest and most severe? Consider before, during, and after the experience.
  > When/Where: I see the most concerning effect after the usage of the app, since the user has not access nor visibility to the storage and usage of the collected data.
- How could the impact be mitigated? Consider both users as well as designers of the experience.
  > How could the impact be mitigated? I don't have an answer, but a mitigation of the issue could be done educating the user and let them know about the data shared.
